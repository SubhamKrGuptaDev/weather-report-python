### Introduction

A simple but very useful project that will tell the user the weather of any city he/she wants. Till date the project backend works on Command Line Interface (CLI). This project mainly uses the Weather API mentioned below to find the weather of the city the user wants. In future we will be adding and integrating this to the Frontend part.

### External Resources Used

* [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

### Technical Resources Used

* Python


### Future Options

* Integrating the CLI project to the Frontend.
* Adding mapping according to the weather predicted.
* Adding options so that users can filter out their suitable mode of transports.
* Making the UI in the Frontend much user-friendly.
